# CallSense - Customer Call Analytics Dashboard

> **Transform customer calls into actionable business insights with AI-powered sentiment analysis and real-time analytics.**

## 🚨 The Problem: The Hidden Cost of Poor Call Management

### **The Scale of the Issue**

- **67% of customers** hang up due to poor call experiences
- **$75 billion** lost annually by businesses due to poor customer service
- **89% of customers** switch to competitors after a bad call experience
- **Average cost** of acquiring a new customer is **5-25x more** than retaining an existing one

### **What Businesses Are Missing**

Most businesses are **flying blind** when it comes to customer calls:

- **No visibility** into call sentiment or customer satisfaction
- **No analytics** to identify patterns or trends
- **No insights** to improve customer experience
- **No early warning** system for customer churn
- **No data-driven** decisions for customer success

### **The Real Impact**

- **Silent churn**: Customers leave without warning
- **Missed opportunities**: Upselling chances go unnoticed
- **Reactive support**: Problems only addressed after escalation
- **Poor ROI**: No measurement of call effectiveness
- **Team inefficiency**: No data to optimize support processes
